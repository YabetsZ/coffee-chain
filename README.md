## ☕️ CoffeeChain — Fairness & Transparency in Every Cup

### Mission

**CoffeeChain** is a transparency-focused web app that empowers farmers, businesses, and consumers by revealing the full journey of a coffee product — from farm to cup.  
We aim to make the coffee supply chain **fairer, traceable, and more accountable**, by tracking every stage of production and showing **how the price evolves** along the way.

### What Problem Are We Solving?

In today’s global coffee trade:

- 🧑‍🌾 **Farmers are underpaid** despite rising coffee prices.
- 🔍 **Supply chains lack visibility**, allowing for fraud, greenwashing, and unfair pricing.
- 🏷️ **Consumers can’t verify** origin, practices, or ethical claims.
- 🏢 **Companies struggle** to prove sourcing integrity or analyze supply chain margins.
